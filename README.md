### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile

👨🏽‍💻 I'm Andrés Membrilo, specializing in 📈 **Data Analysis** and **Data Science**. 

🗂 Here you can find the **main projects** I have worked with Python, and a description of them:

* 🔍 [Customer clustering based on consumer behavior](https://github.com/AndresMembrillo/proyecto-usisa/tree/main/segmentacion%20clientes): This project for [USISA](https://www.usisa.com/) develops a comprehensive customer segmentation model utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm, geolocating each cluster by postal code, and integrating visualization through Power BI.
* 📈 [Sales analysis and forecasting](https://github.com/AndresMembrillo/proyecto-usisa/tree/main/predicci%C3%B3n%20ventas): Sales analysis and forecasting for [USISA](https://www.usisa.com/), utilizing models from pycaret.timeseries. Additionally, it incorporates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through Power BI for comprehensive insights.
* 🐟 [Product recommendation system](https://github.com/AndresMembrillo/proyecto-usisa/tree/main/sistema%20%20recomendacion%20productos): This [USISA](https://www.usisa.com/) project focuses on developing a product recommendation system based on past purchases of other users. It employs the Apriori algorithm with association rules to provide personalized recommendations.
* 📌   [AI image recognition](https://github.com/AndresMembrillo/AI_image_recognition#AI): In response to the rise of AI-generated images, our challenge is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that distinguishes between authentic and AI-generated images, ensuring reliability in digital content.
* 🏆 [Kaggle competitions](https://github.com/AndresMembrillo/kaggle-competitions/tree/main/Kaggle%20competitions): Check my Kaggle projects and competition entries!
